David Herron is a software engineer, blogger and writer living in Silicon Valley.  He has over 20 years software engineering experience for hi-tech companies in Silicon Valley, including a 10+ year stint in the Java SE team at Sun Microsystems.

While working at Yahoo he was exposed to Node.js when the team David worked in was reassigned to work on the beginning phases of Yahoo's Node.js webapp hosting platform - Manhattan and Mojito.  Yahoo now uses Node.js widely for the apps it deploys to build its websites, and the company also makes Mojito available as an open source project.  David left Yahoo long before the Manhattan/Mojito platform became public, however.
