## ISBN Numbers

The International ISBN Agency ([isbn-international.org](https://www.isbn-international.org/)) oversee's all-things-ISBN around the world.  They empower individual agencies in each country to issue ISBN's for that country.

[fonerbooks.blogspot.com/2005/07/how-to-obtain-isbn-number_05.html](http://www.fonerbooks.blogspot.com/2005/07/how-to-obtain-isbn-number_05.html) -- is an old discussion, from 2005, going over ISBN's and where to get them (in the U.S.).  The key take-away that's still true is that it's a good idea to own your ISBN.  There are plenty of companies today which give ISBN's for free as part of a package of book publishing services.  Those services may be worth-while, but at the end of the process that service company owns the ISBN.

## EPUB specification

The EPUB specification was previously developed by the IDPF.  As of January 2017, the IDPF has merged itself into the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with a home page at https://www.w3.org/publishing/

Github repository: https://github.com/w3c/publ-cg/

The links below are still (as of this writing) informative but are an archive of the status of the IDPF as of January 2017.

O'Reilly has published two books of interest, both of which were very useful in developing AkashaEPUB and this guide:

* EPUB 3 Best Practices
* Accessible EPUB 3
